    <h2 id="lorem1">C Compilers and IDE</h2>
    <p>
      A compiler transforms and translates a high-end language to machine (low level) understandable language.
      The compiling process does basic translation mechanisms and also error detection. Basically, it translates
      your code written in basic English to a language the machine can understand and perform according to the
      given command.</p>

    <p>To write this code you need a platform integrated with the compilers known as IDE (Integrated Development
      Environment). Some examples of C IDEs are: </p>
    <p> ❖ Code::Blocks: It is a free, open-source cross-platform IDE that supports multiple compilers
      including GCC, Clang and Visual C++.</p>
    <p>Download Link: http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads</p>
    <p>Interface :</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/beginner/interface.jpeg" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>❖ Eclipse: It is an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It contains a
      base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment.</p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="lorem2">Components of a C program:</h2>
    <p>As we are now all set to begin with our coding. Lets first discuss what are some important
      components every C program contains</p>

    <h4>Constants and Variables:</h4>
    <p>
      A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate.
      Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of
      the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of
      operations that can be applied to it.
    <p>There are some rules that are to be followed during construction of a variable:
    <ul>
      <li>-It can only contain 32 letters (alphabets, numbers, underscore)</li>
      <li>-No special character/blanks except an underscore (‘_’) can be used in a variable</li>
      <li>-The variable name must begin with an alphabet or underscore only.</li>
      <li>-The name of variable can’t be a keyword.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Example of some valid variable names: _emp_, Abc123, book_212 etc;</p>
    <p>
      Constants in C are the fixed values that are used in a program, and its value remains the same
      during the entire execution of the program. Constants are also called literals. Constants can be
      any of the data types. These are basically the values specified for a given variable at a particular
      point of time.</p>
    <p>ExamplesX=5 or y=10.34</p>
    <p>Here x and y are the variable names and the values given to them i.e. 5 and 10.34 are the
      constants specified to them.
    </p>

    <h4>Keywords: </h4>
    <p>Keywords are predefined, reserved words in C language and each of which is associated with
      specific features. These words help us to use the functionality of C language. They have special
      meaning to the compilers.</p>
    <p>Some examples of keyword are:
      int, float, break, while, double continue, etc.</p>
    <h4> Header Files:</h4>
    <p>

      A header file is a file with extension “.h” which contains C function declarations and macro
      definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files
      that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.</p>
    <p>
      It is the most important part of the code and is usually written at the very beginning of the code.</p>
    <p>
      Including a header file gives access to all the keywords and pre-defined functions listed in the file.</p>
    <p>
      You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C pre-processing</p>
    <p>
      directive #include.</p>
    <p>
      Syntax-</p>
    <p>
      #include<header_file>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some mostly used header files in C are:</p>
    <p>
      <img class="image" src="images/beginner/header.jpeg" alt="">
    </p>
    <h2 id="lorem3">Data Types and their Format Specifier:</h2>
    <p>Each variable in C has an associated data type. Each data type requires different amounts of
      memory and has some specific operations which can be performed over it.</p>
    <p>Following are the examples of some very common data types used in C:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>❖ char: The most basic data type in C. It stores a single character and requires a single byte
        of memory in almost all compilers.</li>
      <li>
        ❖ int: As the name suggests, an int variable is used to store an integer.</li>
      <li>❖ float: It is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point value) with single
        precision.</li>
      <li>❖ double: It is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point value) with double
        precision.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The format specifiers are used in C for input and output purposes. Using this concept, the compiler
      can understand that what type of data is in a variable during taking input and printing data.
      A list of data types and their format specifiers:</p>


    <img class="image" src="images/beginner/1dt.jpeg" alt="">
    <img class="image" src="images/beginner/2dt.jpeg" alt="">



    <h2 id="lorem4">Input/ Output Commands:</h2>
    <p> When we say Input, it means to feed some data into a program. An input can be given in the form
      of a file or from the command line and an Output, means to display some data on screen, printer,
      or in any file. C programming provides a set of built-in functions to read the given input and functions
      to output the data on the computer screen.</p>
    <h4>printf() Function:</h4>
    <p>In C programming, printf() is one of the main output function. The function sends formatted output
      to the screen.</p>
    <p>Syntax: printf(“ out put data “);</p>
    <p> Example:</p>
    <p>printf(“ First statement “); // it will give the output as the text included in the quotes.</p>
    <p> To print the value of a variable or include variables in your output you have to specify the format
      specifier for the data type.</p>
    <p>Syntax: printf(“ output data characters format_specifier “,variable_name);</p>
    <p> Example:</p>
    <p>
    <pre>
        int x=10;
        printf(“The value of x is %d”,x);

        Output: The value of x is 10
    </pre>
    </p>

    <h4>scantf() Function:</h4>
    <p> In C programming, scanf() is one of the commonly used function to take input from the user.</p>
    <p>The scanf() function reads formatted input from the standard input such as keyboards.</p>
    <p>To read the value of a variable you need to specify the format specifier of the variable data type
      and then the variable name preceded by the “&” sign.</p>
    <p>Syntax : scanf(“Format_specifier”,&variable_name);</p>
    <p>&variable_name gives the address of the variable and the input value is stored at that address.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
    <pre>
        float x;
        printf(“Enter the value of x”);
        scanf(“%f”,&x);
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p> When this statement is run, it will ask the user to input the value of float variable x.</p>

    <h2 id="lorem5">First C program:</h2>
    <p>After studying the components of a C program, we are all set for First code. Before that let’s go
      through some rules that you should keep in mind whenever we are writing a code:
      -Each instruction should be written as a separate statement</p>
    <ul>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li>-C follows sequential execution, so statements should be written in order you want them to be
        followed</li>
      <li>-insert blank spaces between words.</li>
      <li>-C is case sensitive and most of the in-built commands are in lowercase</li>
      <li>-Every instruction or statement should be terminated with a semi-colon (“;”);</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Thus, for our 1st program we are going to print the statement “HELLO WORLD!!”;</p>

    <h2 id="lorem6">Extras in a glance</h2>
    <h4>Errors in C:</h4>
    <p>Error is an illegal operation performed by the user which results in abnormal working of the
      program.</p>
    <p>Programming errors often remain undetected until the program is compiled or executed. Some of
      the errors inhibit the program from getting compiled or executed. The most common errors can be
      broadly classified as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> ❖ Syntax errors: Errors that occur when you violate the rules of writing C syntax are known as
        syntax errors. This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code
        can be compiled. All these errors are detected by compiler and thus are known as compiletime errors. Example:
        <ul>
          <li>-Missing Parenthesis (})</li>
          <li>-Printing the value of variable without declaring it</li>
          <li>-Missing semicolon</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>❖ Run-time Errors: Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful
        compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time errors is division
        by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler
        doesn’t point to the line at which the error occurs.</li>
      <li>❖ Logical Errors: On compilation and execution of a program, desired output is not obtained
        when certain input values are given. These types of errors which provide incorrect output
        but appears to be error free are called logical errors. These are one of the most common
        errors done by beginners of programming.</li>
      <li>❖ Semantic errors: This error occurs when the statements written in the program are not
        meaningful to the compiler.
        Example:
        a+b=c;</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Comments in C:</h4>
    <p> Comments are statements that are not executed by the compiler and interpreter. In programming,
      a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a program. It
      is a good practice as a programmer to write comments as it makes a program more readable and
      error finding become easier.</p>
    <p>In C there are two types of comments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>-Single line comment : Represented as // double forward slash. It applies comment to a single line
        only. Example:
        <pre>int emp_no=1245; // the employee no. is 1245</pre></li>
      <li> -Multi-line comment : Represented as /* any_text */ start with forward slash and asterisk (/*) and
        end with asterisk and forward slash (*/). It is used to denote multi-line comment. Example:
      <pre>
        /*Comment starts
        . . .
        Data/text
        . . .
        Comment ends*/
      </pre></li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Escape Sequence in C:</h4>
    <p>Generally, an escape sequence begins with a backslash ‘\’ followed by a character or characters. it
      has a special meaning to the compiler. Escape sequences are used to format the output text and
      are not generally displayed on the screen. Each escape sequence has its own predefined function.
      Some common and useful escape sequences you can take note of are:</p>

      <img class="image" src="images/beginner/escape.jpeg" alt="">

      <p>Escape sequences store only 1 byte in memory and can be used the same way we print any
        output on Console by inserting them wherever required in the printf function.</p>

    <h4>Operators in C:</h4>
    <p>C language supports a rich set of built-in operators. An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler
      to perform a certain mathematical or logical manipulation. Operators are used in programs to
      manipulate data and variables.
      C operators can be classified into following types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>❖ Arithmetic operators</li>
        <li>❖ Relational operators</li>
        <li>❖ Logical operators</li>
        <li>❖ Bitwise operators</li>
        <li>❖ Assignment operators</li>
        <li>❖ Conditional operators</li>
        <li>❖ Special operators</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>1. Arithmetic Operators</h5>
    <p>
      All the basic arithmetic operators are supported in C.</p>
      <img class="image" src="images/beginner/add.jpeg" alt="">
      <h5>2. Relational Operators </h5>
    <p>Operators used to compare the two operands. Such as:</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/beginner/relational.jpeg" alt="">
    <h5>3. Logical Operators </h5>
    <p>C language supports following 3 logical operators.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>❖ Logical AND (&&):</li>
      <p><img class="image" src="images/beginner/and.jpeg" alt=""></p>
      <li>❖ Logical OR (||):</li>
      <p><img class="image" src="images/beginner/or.jpeg" alt=""></p>
      <li>❖ NOT(!):</li>
      <p><img class="image" src="images/beginner/not.jpeg" alt=""></p>
    </ul>
    <h5>4. Assignment Operators</h5>
    <p>Used to assign values to variables. Example</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/beginner/assignment.jpeg" alt="">
    </li>
    <h5>5. Special Operators </h5>
    <img class="image" src="images/beginner/spop.jpeg" alt="">
    <h4>Program showing use of Operators:</h4>
    <p>Now that we have learned about all the operators and data types and variables. Let’s write a code
      performing different arithmetic operations on variables.</p>
