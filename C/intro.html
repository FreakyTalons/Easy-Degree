        <p class="not_dark">
          C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed
          in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is
          the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with
          Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software
          programmers.
        </p>
        <p class="dark">
          Like most procedural languages in the ALGOL tradition, C has facilities for structured programming and allows 
          lexical variable scope and recursion. Its static type system prevents unintended operations. In C, all executable 
          code is contained within subroutines (also called "functions", though not strictly in the sense of functional programming). 
          Function parameters are always passed by value. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing pointer values. C 
          program source text is free-format, using the semicolon as a statement terminator and curly braces for grouping blocks of statements.

          <h3>A bit of history</h3>
          <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. 
            It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.</p>
