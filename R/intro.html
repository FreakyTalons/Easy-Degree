        <p class="not_dark">
          When you see powerful analytics, statistics, and visualizations used by data scientists and business leaders, chances are that the R language is behind them. Open-source R is the statistical programming language that data experts the world over use for everything from mapping broad social and marketing trends online to developing financial and climate models that help drive our economies and communities.
          R was first implemented in the early 1990’s by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka, both faculty members at the University of Auckland. The R language was closely modeled on the S Language for Statistical Computing conceived by John Chambers, Rick Becker, Trevor Hastie, Allan Wilks and others at Bell Labs in the mid 1970s, and made publicly available in the early 1980’s. Robert and Ross established R as an open source project in 1995.Since 1997, the R project has been managed by the R Core Group. And, in February 2000, came the first release of R.

          R is a language! You do data analysis by writing functions and scripts, not by pointing and clicking. That may sound daunting if you are new to programming, but R is an easy language to learn, and a very natural and expressive one for data analysis. Working with R is an interactive experience that encourages experimentation, exploration and play. It is likely that whatever your area of interest, you will find R packages(libraries of functions) that will be immediately helpful. And, of course, R is renowned for its capabilities to visualize data.
