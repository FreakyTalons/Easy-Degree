            This is Kanit Mann, pursuing his BTech from Vellore Institute of
            Technology, Vellore, and that is the only boring thing about him.
            Don't be surprised if you find him in labs at 1:00AM discussing
            ideas and debugging programs. For him, jack of all trades is a myth
            as he has mastered all that he touches, may it be graphic designing,
            marketing, management, image processing, or completely non-tech
            related, like poetry. After (not) getting tired of all this he
            escapes to his own imaginery world where he is on the lookout for
            some path-breaking invention or some poetic adventure of which he
            can later write about.

            is gifted with such a sweet voice like her's she can't not enjoy it!
            She is a self-admitted music freak who also likes to sketch now and
