                <h3>Kanit Mann</h3>
                <span>Founder</span>
                <p>This is Kanit Mann, pursuing his BTech from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, and that is the only boring thing about him. Don't be surprised if you find him in labs at 1:00AM discussing ideas and debugging programs. For him, jack of all trades is a myth as he has mastered all that he touches, may it be graphic designing, marketing, management, image processing, or completely non-tech related, like poetry. After (not) getting tired of all this he escapes to his own imaginery world where he is on the lookout for some path-breaking invention or some poetic adventure of which he can later write about.</p>
